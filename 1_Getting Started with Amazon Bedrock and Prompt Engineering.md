# Getting Started with Amazon Bedrock and Prompt Engineering

Amazon Bedrock is a fully-managed service that makes Foundation Models (FMs) from leading AI companies like AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI, Stability AI, and Amazon available through a single API. You can choose a FM that's best suited for your use case.

This course covers the basics of foundational models (FMs) and how you can use them to perform natural language processing tasks such as text classification, text summarization, and zero-shot or few-shot learning.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this class, you will be able to:

- Use LLMs to perform tasks such as text summarization, and text classification.
- Invoke LLMs and pass model parameters using the Amazon Bedrock API through code.
- Use zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompts to improve model outputs.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of machine learning terminology (e.g., data, model, prediction).
- Basic coding proficiency (Python) and familiarity with coding environments, such as Jupyter notebooks.
